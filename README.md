This is a Simplified JavaScript , with comments and more explanation in the files from each lecture. 

How to navigate to the lecture.

Each lecture has it own branch in the repository and the lecture of the previous class in case you  want to  check  any reference, to see the code for a specific lecture,
just select from the branch "drop-down". E.g lecture-15 branch contains the final code for lecture 15 in the training.
